# strobeck_fm

This project looks at what songs William Strobeck uses in his skate videos. It gets data by scraping skatevideosite.com and uses LASTFM to get more info about the track songs. The webscrape aspect comes into play as there is few openly avaiable data repos related to skateboarding. The idea behind this came to me while watching "CHERRY" for the 20th time. 

All courtesy goes to skatevideosite.com please check them out! 

## What it does

- **Web scraping:** Collects Strobeck's skate parts from skatevideosite.com

- **Data visualization:** Shows trends and patterns in good ole Bill's music taste
